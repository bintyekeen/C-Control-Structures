The four stages of C compilation are:
1. Preprocssing:handles directives like #include and #define before actual compilation
2. Compiling: Translates the preprocessed code into assembly code for the target machine.
3. Assembling: converts the assembly code into machine code.
4. Linking: combines object files and libraries into final executable program.
